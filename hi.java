/*functions in trees are done in O(logN) times 
unbalanced binary tree
size = no of blocks
siblings(nodes side by side)
heigh - max number of edges between two node 



complete Binary tree
all level apart from the leaf will be full
and all if the last level is full it will be filled from left to right 


Full Binary Tree
Each node has either zero or two children



Perfect Binary Tree
triangle \


Height balanced tree:- average height O(logN)


Skewed Binary tree every Node has only one childd


Ordered Bnary Tree - Every node has a property
